Since React is a JavaScript library, it is essential to understand the basic and important features of JavaScript. Not everything in JavaScript, just the essentials:

### JavaScript

If you have been into web development for sometime now, you've probably heard of or seen JavaScript somewhere.

> Well, JavaScript is a programming language used in client side scripting and also in the backend - Just a heads up

There are plenty of free and paid courses and tutorials for JavaScript. To see the list, visit the link below: https://github.com/ChrisAchinga/JavaScript101

#### Arrow Functions

Arrow functions are an alternative to the traditional function expressions. They utilize a new token, => that looks like arrow hence the name.

```javascript
function() {
    //code block
}
```

An Arrow function would look like:

```javascript
() => {
  //code block
};
```

#### Classes

JavaScript classes are more like special function

#### ES6 Features

React uses latest JavaAcript es6 features. So it's a good idea to go through them.
